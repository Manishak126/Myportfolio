              I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer specializing in the MERN
              stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). With a strong
              foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I create
              dynamic, responsive web applications that deliver exceptional user
              experiences. My expertise spans from designing intuitive
              interfaces to implementing robust server-side logic, ensuring
              seamless performance and scalability. Passionate about continuous
              learning and staying updated with industry trends, I thrive on
              tackling new challenges and contributing to innovative projects.{" "}
